The cheapest way for a professional looking front panel is to use the service of a sign manufacturer. For example:

Price of a 380x110mm front panel: 5$

You can use the template under hardware/Frontpanel, but you have to adapt the size of the front panel file to your case. Use eg. https://inkscape.org
