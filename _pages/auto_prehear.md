Before playing a song, the first note can be preheared. The sound is only hearable at the headphone output but not at the speaker (and so not for the audience).

## Activate prehear mode

Step 1: The timbremin must be muted by the [Auto-mute mode]({{ site.baseurl }}/auto_mute/ "Auto-mute mode"). Reactivate it by moving both hands to the antennas.
